This repository is a collection of ML models for classifying doodles. The collection currently includes a **Naive Bayes**, and a **Simple Neural Network** classifiers.

All the models are deployed in a [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) web app at http://doodleclassifier.pythonanywhere.com/, with a canvas for drawing your own images to be classified.
